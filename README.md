# ICE_analysis
In this project, I analyzed a dataset from Ice, an online video game store, to uncover trends and factors that contribute to the success of video games, using data on user and expert reviews, genres, platforms, and historical sales. The goal was to identify key characteristics of top-performing games to guide Ice in optimizing their inventory and formulating effective advertising strategies.

The project demonstrated a wide array of data analysis competencies, including data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and hypothesis testing. I showcased my ability to clean and organize complex data, identify and interpret meaningful patterns in game sales, and use statistical methods to compare user ratings, ultimately providing Ice with data-driven insights for business enhancement.
